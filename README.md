```

yarn install # or npm install
gatsby develop # or yarn run develop
```


Running `gatsby develop` you will see the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8000/___graphql
http://localhost:8000/admin
```

1. **blog and pages directories**:
   All markdown files to generate pages and posts.

2. **config**:
   All language settings: languages, strings, menu...
   In `i18n.js` you can set the languages and some others important info

3. **src**:
   Components, hooks, templates and fixed pages

4. **static**:
   Netlify settings and images.

5. **gatsby-browser.js**:

## About Netlify CMS

You must change the Netlify data "repo" and "site_domain" according your Github repository in `static/admin/config.yml`.

```
backend:
    name: github # Local
    # name: git-gateway # Prod
    repo: _owner-name/repo-name_ # Path to your GitHub repository
    branch: master
    site_domain: _site-url_ # If site extists
```

Realize that you need to use `name: github` for local development and `name: git-gateway` for prod environment (netlify)

## Important notes:

-   General information for languages are defined in `config/i18n.js`.
-   Due to the use of a global layout / context API and the language code passed to all pages (see `gatsby-node.js`), you know on all pages which language is currently displayed.
-   Blogposts are defined in `blog` directory and pages are defined in `pages` directory. The file names are the `slug` of the posts and pages.
-   A custom component for the <a> tag is implemented - this way links can stay the same for every language, without the need to manually write path prefixes.
