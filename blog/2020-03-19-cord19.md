The world currently stands united in solidarity against a common
opponent: COVID-19, a virus also referred to simply as coronavirus. In
just a matter of weeks, the virus has spread across the world at an
exponential rate (duh, that's how it works). Because many members of
the data science community are now home-based for most of their time,
wondering how their skills can be used to help eradicate the virus.
There are many ways, but there is an especially meaningful way that has
come straight from the White House itself: CORD-19.

## Motivation

Before we get to that, let's take a step back and ensure we are all
familiarized with how viruses spread, time and time again.

Kevin Simler of 
[MeltingAsphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/) has built
a great 
[series of interactive figures](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/), which show
how *any* virus spreads (code
[here](https://github.com/kevinsimler/outbreak).

John's Hopkins University (JHU) has stepped up to help
_big-time_, providing ongoing tracking of a number of analyses across the world. Click through their
plots below, showing global cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.

They've also created a stunning dashboard, which includes an ArcGIS map
of confirmed cases. The tables to either side of the map tabulate cases
and deaths when broken out by country. For readers in the US, take note
of the density of the cases in Europe. Experts are saying that the US
has not done enough to prevent this density from occurring here in 1-2
weeks. Poke around the figures below, it's all interactive within this
page:

Ok, back to viruses. We're all refreshed on how they spread via
exponential growth (to be pedantic, it's actually logistic growth). For
a visual explanation of this process playing out with COVID-19, look no
further than Grant Sanderson's amazing

## CORD-19 Overview

I imagine you are sufficiently motivated by now. Those who are not are
likely still playing with the maps above. Regardless, I am glad you are
motivated because we now have work to do.

The White House has issued a 
[call to action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/)
to the technology community to derive insights from a vast body of
coronavirus literature. The data (CORD-19) is mostly text articles about
various coronaviruses. Therefore, it calls most strongly to the Natural
Language Processing (NLP) community for insights. Everyone, prepare
yourselves for the coming influx of
[Sesame-Street-themed](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/20993407/ai-language-models-muppets-sesame-street-muppetware-elmo-bert-ernie)
model names coming from this: CORDBERT, BERTID19, CoronaBERT, etc.

At this point, many data science veterans will scoff and gripe about how
most of their time would be spent **preparing** the data as opposed to
**using** it. I have good news: CORD-19 is machine-readable right out of
the box.

Kaggle, a data science community now under Google's umbrella, has
formed official challenges from the call to action. Here's your
step-by-step process to get up and running:

1. Read the [main page](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) for
   the CORD-19 data.
2. Review the
   [tasks](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks)
   for the main Kaggle challenge.
3. Review [existing analyses](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/kernels)
   made by other users.
4. [Discuss](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion)
   findings with other users.
5. Participate in the [Week 1 forecasting challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1).
   Consider using a
   [DeepNote](https://www.lifewithdata.org/blog/deepnote-sets-course-to-become-the-jupyter-killer)
   notebook for analysis or
   [AutoML](https://www.lifewithdata.org/blog/with-autogluon-aws-brings-automl-to-their-platform)
   to automatically train a model.
