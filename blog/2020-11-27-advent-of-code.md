How many times have you recently had some of these conversations with
yourself? Chances are, you have at least a few times, and most of us
will also readily admit that we also haven't done much of anything about
it. Well, here's a fun holiday season routine for you that can help you
out: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)!

# What It Is

Advent of Code is an annual series of daily coding challenges that
happens during the year-end holiday season. While its name alludes to
Christian traditions, it is a simple pun choice meant to convey the
25-day nature of the series (come one, come all!). Each day, between the
1st and 25th of December, a new puzzle is published. The puzzles usually
string along a wonderfully-constructed storyline, keeping you
entertained as you are challenged. Here's an example from last year:

> ### Example Puzzle (Day 1 2018)
>
> After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at
> the device's tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before
> first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination
> lock." Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in
> frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current
> frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency
> decreases by 3.
>
> For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3,
> +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes
> would occur:
>
> Current frequency 0, change of +1; resulting frequency 1. Current
> frequency 1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1. Current frequency
> -1, change of +3; resulting frequency 2. Current frequency 2, change
> of +1; resulting frequency 3. In this example, the resulting frequency
> is 3.
>
> Here are other example situations:
>
> +1, +1, +1 results in 3 +1, +1, -2 results in 0 -1, -2, -3 results in
> -6
>
> *Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency
> after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?*

At this point, a link is available on the page for you to obtain the
full input sequence (about a thousand inputs) as a text file. This is
where the rubber meets the road between your problem-solving skills and
software implementation know-how.

Be careful! Most people will happily¬†*nose dive*¬†into regurgitating code
that reads the input, and then face-plant when they realize it's time to
implement the core algorithm. Take the time first to make sure you fully
understand the problem at hand, and (at least mentally) form the
algorithmic solution before rushing to the I/O code.

Additionally, do not underestimate the complexity of the series. By
design, it starts gently, allowing everyone to get their feet wet with
it. Day after day, you will notice the complexity creep in, with the
puzzles taking you minutes longer. Stick with it! You will be challenged
before it is over.

Most of the participants I know use Advent of Code as a way to simple
practice. For the more competitive spirits, a global (and within-group,
if you join one) leaderboard provides additional motivation to find the
solution *quickly*. You can find the derivation of the scoring mechanism
as well as the top 25 of 2019's competition in the image below.
Regardless of your motivation, it's a lot of fun and good for your
professional development.

# Why You Should Do It

You don't need to use any sort of significant computing hardware to
participate in these challenges -- feel free to leave your
cloud-computing mindset to the side, and get yourself back into the
single machine, single problem mindset of your first data structures and
algorithms endeavor üòâ. The puzzles, designed personally
by¬†[Eric](http://was.tl/)¬†üëè, are designed such that solving the problem
in brute-force fashion will take entirely too long, but solving in a
more intelligent fashion will solve the puzzle in at most 15 seconds on
commodity hardware.

You don't need to use any sort of super-duper optimized programming
language, either. Note that, since the correct approach to the puzzle
will give you the answer in seconds, the true differentiator in
solutions is¬†*development time*. Thus, an appropriate approach in an
interpreted language (Python, R, etc) will prevail over a naive approach
written in a compiled language (C, Rust, Go, etc). I love this aspect.
Some folks love to gripe about \<insert outdated language\> how¬†is the
best because you can always optimize it to run faster and closer to the
bare metal etc etc etc. However, how fast your algorithm runs on
hardware is usually not the bottleneck in your end system:

> The more expensive factors of an algorithmic solution tend to be
> things like developer time-to-solution, lack of parallelism, or I/O
> congestion, as opposed to compiler-enabled program optimization.

When was the last time you were in an interview for an established
software company, and they constrained you to a language of
choice?¬†Usually, you were instead constrained to (either explicitly, or
implicitly via a failed interview!) providing a solution that was
modular, efficient, and scalable. All of these things are capable in any
Turing-complete language. So forget about language wars for this series,
and focus on the real intellectual meat of the problem.

Indeed, many dispose of the competition aspect altogether, and use
Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn/practice a new language.
Personally, I plan to do my first pass in Python, and then follow up in
either Rust or Kotlin (gotta stay future-proof üßê ). Whether you are
looking for intense competition, a learning opportunity, or a chance to
establish a good habit this holiday season, consider finding it in
Advent of Code!

not, what would change your mind?

Do you have tried-and-tested ways to ensure the habit of completing
daily tasks like this for extended periods of time?
