  excerpt: "At Uber, several petabytes of data move across and within various platforms\
    \ every day. We power this data movement by a strong backbone of data pipelines.\
    \ Whether it\u2019s ingesting the data from millions of Uber trips or transforming\
    \ the ingested data for analytical and machine learning models,\_it all runs through\
    \ these pipelines. To put it in perspective, Uber\u2019s data platform runs upwards\
    \ of 15,000 data pipelines!\nBut over time, the existing Python framework-based\
    \ methods started showing a productivity tax on pipeline creators. The growing\
    \ population of data-analysts and city-operations users inside Uber depended on\
    \ a handful of data engineers to create their pipelines. What could be a few hours\
    \ work often turned into a few days or weeks. In addition to that, the demand\
    \ for real-time data and insights also grew quickly within Uber. But with a completely\
    \ different technology stack and the complexities of building a real-time pipeline,\
    \ we could not adopt real-time insight as quickly as we wanted. And getting the\
    \ code right was even trickier.\nThe need for a simpler, unified, and intuitive\
    \ user experience for building data workflows was the main impetus behind uWorc,\
    \ Unified Workflow Orchestrator.\n"

    text: Non-model components to consider in the ML development process
    href: https://rubikscode.net/2020/11/30/18-machine-learning-best-practices
  excerpt: "Machine Learning and Deep Learning (AI, in general) are no longer just\
    \ buzzwords. They became an integral part of our businesses and startups. This\
    \ affects software development too, in fact, it goes even further. We can\u2019\
    t observe machine learning components just as another part of the ecosystem, because\
    \ they are part of the system that makes decisions. These components also are\
    \ shifting our focus to data, which brings a different mindset when it comes to\
    \ the infrastructure. Because of all these things building machine learning-based\
    \ applications is not an easy task. There are several areas where data scientists,\
    \ software developers and DevOps engineers need to work together in order to make\
    \ a high-quality product.\n"

  excerpt: "Last June, I published the post\_What I learned from looking at 200 machine\
    \ learning tools. The post got some attention and I got a lot of messages from\
    \ people telling me about new tools. I updated the old list to now include 284\
    \ tools. I\u2019ll keep on updating the list as I find out about new tools. Any\
    \ lead would be much appreciated!\nWhile looking for these MLOps tools, I discovered\
    \ some interesting points about the MLOps landscape:\n1\\. Increasing focus on\
    \ deployment\n2\\. The Bay Area is still the epicenter of machine learning, but\
    \ not the only hub\n3\\. MLOps infrastructure in the US and China are diverging\n\
    4\\. More interests in machine leanring production from academia\n"

  title: 'How to Talk When a Machine is Listening: Corporate Disclosure in the Age
    of AI'

  excerpt: 'This paper analyzes how corporate disclosure has been reshaped by machine
    processors, employed by algorithmic traders, robot investment advisors, and quantitative
    analysts. Our findings indicate that increasing machine and AI readership, proxied
    by machine downloads, motivates firms to prepare filings that are more friendly
    to machine parsing and processing. Moreover, firms with high expected machine
    downloads manage textual sentiment and audio emotion in ways catered to machine
    and AI readers, such as by differentially avoiding words that are perceived as
    negative by computational algorithms as compared to those by human readers, and
    by exhibiting speech emotion favored by machine learning software processors.
    The publication of Loughran and McDonald (2011) is instrumental in attributing
    the change in the measured sentiment to machine and AI readership. While existing
    research has explored how investors and researchers apply machine learning and
    computational tools to quantify qualitative information from disclosure and news,
    this study is the first to identify and analyze the feedback effect on corporate
    disclosure decisions, i.e., how companies adjust the way they talk knowing that
    machines are listening.

  title: A Gentle Introduction to Deep Learning for Graphs

  excerpt: 'The adaptive processing of graph data is a long-standing research topic
    which has been lately consolidated as a theme of major interest in the deep learning
    community. The snap increase in the amount and breadth of related research has
    come at the price of little systematization of knowledge and attention to earlier
    literature. This work is designed as a tutorial introduction to the field of deep
    learning for graphs. It favours a consistent and progressive introduction of the
    main concepts and architectural aspects over an exposition of the most recent
    literature, for which the reader is referred to available surveys. The paper takes
    a top-down view to the problem, introducing a generalized formulation of graph
    representation learning based on a local and iterative approach to structured
    information processing. It introduces the basic building blocks that can be combined
    to design novel and effective neural models for graphs. The methodological exposition
    is complemented by a discussion of interesting research challenges and applications
    in the field.

    href: https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/DrRepair
  excerpt: 'When writing programs, a lot of time is spent debugging or fixing source
    code errors, both for beginners (imagine the intro programming classes you took)
    as well as for professional developers (for example, [this case study](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42184.pdf)
    from Google ). Automating program repair could dramatically enhance the productivity
    of both programming and learning programming. In our recent work published at
    ICML 2020, we study how to use machine learning to repair programs automatically.
